I developed this library during my time as PhD student in computer games at the computer science department of Maastricht University. 
The library allows to define board-games and apply or test game-playing algorithms. One of the games is Kalah.

The code is as-is and already from 2005. But maybe it is useful for students or game developers in some way.
